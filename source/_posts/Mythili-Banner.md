### Background
This was a banner created for the Mythili Dance Academy that would hang on both sides of the stages the company members would perform on.

### Concept
The goal was to incorporate the logo and the contact information for the organization, as well as provide some aesthetically pleasing decoration. The middle dancers represent the dance form and provide some color that contrasts the logo, similar to many of the traditional outfits worn in this dance form. The top border adds a decorative feel and gives some weight to the banner. The background was chosen to be black as to not distract too much from the stage itself.
