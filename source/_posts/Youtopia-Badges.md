### Background
Youtopia is a platform for gamified service learning that gives users badges based off of completion of certain goals. These badges were made as options for users to set as the badge that would represent different goals.

### Concept
I made various versions of the badge for various badge packs for the platform, samples of which displayed below:

Row One: Color Packs, Row Two: Textures, Row Three: Special Badges for the Chicago Innovation Week

### Design Process
Using a vector of their logo (the circle with a star cutout), I made cutouts of various textures using the vector.
