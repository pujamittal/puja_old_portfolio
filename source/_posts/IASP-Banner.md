### Background
This logo was created for a backdrop for the stage during the event "India Fest" that would be used annually.

### Concept
The darker color was chosen to give a better background for photography, but navy was chosen as it is on both the Indian and American flags. The logo, event title, and organization name are displayed to give purpose to the banner.
