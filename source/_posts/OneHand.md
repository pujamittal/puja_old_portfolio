### Background
The product was born out of the desire to fix the problem of having to carry around so much and rarely having our hands free. This product was a phone attachment that turned a person's phone into a keychain, allowing a user to put their keys and FOBs on their phone, also providing an inexpensive way for users to "call their keys" preventing loss. I designed the logo and co-developed the product itself.

### Concept
The product was called OneHand because, as the tagline suggests, it allows people to put their most important items in one hand rather than a tangled mess in a pocket. Especially for those of us who do not wish to carry purses everywhere, this was a rather useful attachment.

### Design Process (3D Product)
We experimented with various materials (including metals and wood) and designs to attach to the phone, but ultimately we decided to 3D print the attachment and attach it with velcro. We didn't want to constrain the attachment to specific widths of various phone sizes, so we made it compatible with virtually anything. Velcro would attach easily and strongly, but would not leave permanent residue. Plus, it allowed people to place Velcro anywhere and have a dedicated hanging spot for their keys.

We also experimented with various designs to allow a person to wrap their headphones around the attachment, but all configurations proved too bulky or too fragile.
