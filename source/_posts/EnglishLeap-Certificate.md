### Background
This certificate was created to commemorate the completion of the coursework on the platform englishleap.com. The certificate offered verification that the student was proficient in English per the platform's standards.

### Design Process
I used a mixed-media aesthetic, combining the sleek world background with the "real-looking" gold stamp, to represent the virtual world the platform is housed on and the real world value of the learnings.
