### Background
This is a hand-drawn logo for an organization dedicated to ending the neurodegenerative disease ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) named for the mission of its founder, Sarah Martin. 

### Concept
By using a literal representation of the brain and embedding the letters within it, I wanted to highlight the importance of the brain to this mission.

### Design Process
Using a blank outline of a brain, I hand sketched the letters into the brain, also adding "ALS" in the cerebellem.
