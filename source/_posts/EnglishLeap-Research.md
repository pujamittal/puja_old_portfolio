### Background
During the summer of 2014, I worked as a researcher and designer at a startup in New Delhi, India called EnglishLeap whose platform teaches English online through Indian users' native tongues. 

My research project was to develop a customer archetype for the product englishleap.com. I surveyed users to figure out conversion points from non-paying customers to paying customers, and then helped develop products based off of that data. These included a 100 page e-Book that was published on Newshunt (mobile publishing platform) and later became a Bestseller.

### Concept
This poster includes all the necessary fields required for the presentation of my research, but designed in a way that broke the 2003 PowerPoint aesthetic the template we were given came with.
