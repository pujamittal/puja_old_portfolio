### Background
Youtopia is a platform for gamified service learning that gives users badges based off of completion of certain goals. This infographic was designed to replace the welcome email which was 4-5 paragraphs of text detailing how to start.

### Concept
Using screenshots of the platform, I walked the user through seting up their first challenge, including links for more information and a more thorough breakdown.
