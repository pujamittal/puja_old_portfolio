### Background
Youtopia is a platform for gamified service learning that gives users badges based off of completion of certain goals. This poster was created to put up in schools to generate interest for students to join the platform. 

### Concept
Youtopia wanted to promote the fact that service learners using there platform were able to leverage their hours and badges to help with success in college. The slogan "Youtopia helps you succeed in college!" as well as the graduation cap and textbooks give an educational theme to the poster. I used bright colors to draw attention to the poster, and minimal text to give readers something to focus on. The QR code was used for quick access to check out the platform, and the sponsors listed show support via prominent educational partners.

### Improvements
I would have suggested targeting this specific marketing towards high school students instead, given that they could better leverage the service learning in college admission rather than success once in college. I may have used a different background color, to provide more contrast to the blue logo.
