### Background
This was created as a flyer to give out to gentleman wishing to rush the house of Lambda Phi Epsilon.

### Concept
The greek letters were not allowed to be on the flyer itself, so I incorporated the name of the fraternity and the dragon, which is their symbol. Since there was a need to convey the difference between a callout and an event, I differentiated it graphically rather than making the flyer busier. The flyer size was 1/4th of a page of paper, so I had to ensure the text was readable even when small. Hence, I used a thicker font.

### Improvements
The text detailing the requirements for the callouts and events should be spaced out more so the circles do not overlap the text.
