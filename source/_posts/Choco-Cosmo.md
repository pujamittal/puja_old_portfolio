### Background
This logo was created for a startup that allows users to find the culinary spots that locals deem "hidden gems." 

### Concept
The company was called Choco Cosmo after the rare flower species. I incorporated both the flower and a plate into the logo to represent the culinary aspect of the app and incorporate the company's namesake. The plate doubled as the 'C' in both Choco and Cosmo. The "plate" portion of the logo can also be used as a square logo for thumbnails or favicons.

### Design Process
After taking a vector trace of the flower, I arranged the flower within the curves that made the 'C.' I colored one of the curves to the same color of the text and the other the same color of the flower to denote that one was a letter and the other was a graphic.
