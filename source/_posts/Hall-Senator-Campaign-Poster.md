### Background
This poster was created for my own campaign for hall senator whose duties were to be an active member on Student Council and act as a liaison for the students my hall.

### Concept
I wanted to use something punny to represent my personality, hence why I went with the pun. To give the poster utility as well, I embedded proposed solutions on the tissue box, as it fit the theme of the poster. The clown nose represents our hall theme for the year to make it personal to my hall.

### Design Process
I used photos taken by a friend of me and my hand with a tissue box and compiled them with the text on photoshop.

### Improvements
Although my hall was small enough for everyone to know who I was, I should have made my name and position larger so people would remember while voting.
