### Background
This was a logo created for an Indian Classical Dance company that I was a member of.

### Concept
The figure in the logo is Shiva, the lord of dance, who is a large part of the dance form, Bharatanatyam, which is the dance form of dance company. The letters use the shapes of Hindi script and the aesthetic was meant to be very cultural.

### Applications
The logo is seen here in a banner that I also designed:
