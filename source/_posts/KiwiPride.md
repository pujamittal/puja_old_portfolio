### Background
This logo was created for an organization dedicated to spreading LGBTQ pride across New Zealand.

### Concept
The silver fern is a prominent symbol for New Zealand, used on its unofficial flag, official coat of arms, and on its dollar coin. Using the symbol draws a strong connection to the country. The rainbow flag is a worldwide symbol for pride, and combining these two meanings represents the mission of the organization.

### Design Process
Using a vector of the silver fern, I traced the shape out of a rainbow flag in a way that followed the curves of the flag to make it appear that the leaf itself was curving.
