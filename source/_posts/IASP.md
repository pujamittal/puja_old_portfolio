### Background
This logo was created for a the Indo-American Society of Peoria. The purpose of the organization is to share the Indian culture in an American society. 

### Concept
The original logo was:

<img src="/images/posts/IASP/iasp logo old.jpg" style="width: 60%">

The concept of the new logo was to incorporate both the Indian and the American flags, similar to the old logo. Using the colors of the Indian flag as the background. The circle portion is half of the chakra and the other half incorporates the American flag.

### Credits
This was a collaborative project with Vinesh Kannan.
