### Background
This logo was created for a startup that crowdsources professionals to people who want to pay them for advice, info, etc. based on an hourly rate. 

### Concept
Becuase the company was based on forming connections, I used the chat bubbles to represent conversations. They were similar in shape to Q's so I incorported them into the letters.
