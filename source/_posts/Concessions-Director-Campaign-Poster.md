### Background
This poster was created as part of a campaign for Concessions Director whose duties were to oversee the concessions booth at sporting events to generate profit for the Sophomore Class Club.

### Concept
I decided to use the iconic popcorn bags used at concessions stands to immediately give the viewer an idea of the subject of the poster.

### Design Process
Using a vector trace of a popcorn bag, I incorporated the candidate's face and name into the bag to make a unique and personal campaign poster.

### Improvements
There is no call to action, which is almost a necessity on a campaign poster, so I would add in the word "Vote" before the candidate's name and position.
